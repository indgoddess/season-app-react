# Simple Season App created with React 

Idea is to show an appropriate screen and an appropriate message based on lat/long and the month (got using window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition and date library).

Northern Hemisphere - Summer, Southern Hemisphere - Summer months - It shows Orange screen with Sun symbols and message "Lets hit the beach"
Northern Hemisphere - Winter, Southern Hemisphere - Winter months - It shows blule screen with snowflake symbols and message "Burr Its Chill"
